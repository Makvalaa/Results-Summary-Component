## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

I learned how to use font-face media query for local font files, how to create gradients for background. I couldn't figure out how to center the grid both vertically and horizontally when it doesnt have fixed width, but after some digging I finally found answers.



### Continued development

I feel like my codes (both HTML and CSS) are very messy at the moment, and that sometimes I overcomplicate basic tasks when there's a much better and simpler solution.
